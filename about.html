  Jeni Ross designs and makes contemporary woven tapestries. She also paints and
  has designed rugs and tufted wall hangings. Working with yarns offers richness
  and depth of colour and allows her strong colourful designs to bring texture
  and content to both homes and public buildings.


  Jeniâ€™s work can be seen across the UK, in hospitals, theatres, museums and
  government buildings.


  Jeni is primarily concerned with colour and movement. Influences come from
  many sources; fine art, performance, literature. Her designs use layers,
  contrasts and cycles; earth and air, night and day, negative and positive.
  These are interpreted using qualities of theatre; colour and illumination, the
  interplay of planes and textures.
