  "BLUE"&nbsp; Commission for New Ashgate Gallery 2006.


  This installation was commissioned to mark the refurbishment of the gallery
  spaces. Each of the 12 pieces is 360mm high x 300mm wide. Mixed media.


  "This commission, although quite modest in scale has in fact been very
  important in developing my current practice.


  'Colour,' said Johannes Itten, 'affords utility to all, but unveils its deeper
  mysteries only to its devotees.'


  'Just as there are connoisseurs of wine, there are connoisseurs of blue.'
  Colette


  I was excited by the opening up of the space at the New Ashgate Gallery and
  particularly the way the light reverberates around the atrium. The light
  changes at different times of day, year and according to the weather and
  shadows flit across the space.


  All the blues are from the same series and react with each other in each
  piece. So the same blue may look quite different against a dark or a lighter
  background. The shapes are based on shadows, reflections, traces left. The
  black and the yellow sun introduced at each end also alter the perception of
  colour and provide a visual limit or frame for the whole piece. The additional
  flashes of colour which project from the main pieces go from dawn light to
  sunset and are designed to be visible as one passes through the two archways
  and from the first floor windows.
