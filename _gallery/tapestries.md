description_markdown: >-
  Jeni is primarily concerned with colour and movement and her designs involve
  layers, contrasts and cycles; earth and air, night and day, negative and
  positive. These are interpreted using qualities of theatre; colour and
  illumination, the interplay of planes and textures.
