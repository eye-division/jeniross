title: House of Lords tapestry
description_markdown: >-
  The British countryside has been almost entirely changed by man and yet we are
  still deeply influenced by it. The relationships of a figure within a space
  was important to me for this commission and I wanted to convey the feeling of
  the figure as both dominating but also part of the landscape. Starting points
  for the design were paintings such as 'Mr and Mrs Andrews' by Gainsborough and
  the drawings by Samuel Palmer. I often use the idea of night and day existing
  at the same time in my work and I felt this would have particular relevance to
  the workings of parliament.


  A major feature in many antique tapestries is a curtain. This plays with the
  idea of a tapestry&sup1;s function within a room, its physical nature as a
  textile and also with the notion of something revealed. I felt this was also
  relevant and have designed the piece with this in mind.
