title: House of Lords tapestry
description_markdown: >-
  The British countryside has been almost entirely changed by man and yet we are
  still deeply influenced by it. The relationships of a figure within a space
  was important to me for this commission and I wanted to convey the feeling of
  the figure as both dominating but also part of the landscape. I often use the
  idea of night and day existing at the same time in my work and I felt this
  would have particular relevance to the workings of parliament.
