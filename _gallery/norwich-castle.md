  The Norwich Castle Commissions were funded by the National Lottery and
  regional Arts Lottery Programme awards and formed part of the Castle Museum
  refurbishment. I was engaged as one of a team of 6 artists working on this
  major public art project. The brief was to make artworks responding to the
  theme 'A sense of Place'. My contribution celebrates living history; through a
  woven tapestry in the Main Entrance, a large carpet in the Castle Keep and
  etched glass figures on doors through the building.


  The four attributes held by the figures in the tapestry and on the doors
  represent Architecture, Literature, Conflict and Landscape.


  The design of the carpet was developed from aspects of the Castle Keep and the
  artist's personal collection of artefacts from Norfolk.

      &nbsp;4200 x 3200 mm Hand Gun-Tufted Wool Carpet.&nbsp; Designed as a
      sitting space for children taking part in museum activities this carpet
      reveals its true colours gradually as one's eyes get used to the subdued
      lighting necessary in the gloom of the Castle Keep.
