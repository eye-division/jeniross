  2 Panel Tapestry and carpet for the Central Science Laboratory, Ryedale, York.  


  Commissioned by RMJM(London) Ltd (Architects) through Public Arts, Wakefield. The artworks are situated in the main entrance atrium. The tapestries are each 4.5 x 1 metre and the carpet is 7.5 x 4.8 metres.

  The designs are based on a combination of microscopic elements against larger land and water forms, reflecting the work of the Laboratories. The space between the tapestries forms an integral part of the design, carrying the eye from one to the other and using the whole wall space to maximum effect.

  The carpet represents a pond teaming with microscopic forms.
