title: "Artist books"
description_markdown: >-
  "As part of my initial research for the New College tapestries I began experimenting with making a series of small books.  My ideas for the project were related to Johannes Itten's twelve tone colour system and I have translated these into a series of twenty four hour 'clock'  books, starting and ending with midnight and centred on a sun motif in the middle.  

  The classic book  form has a time based narrative; a concertina book on the other hand can be read all at once  offering a more visual experience.  Each of the concertina or leporello books can be opened out into a continuous sheet 3.5 metres long or closed down and arranged in many different ways to give a different visual image each time it is viewed. The simpler book form offers a separate double page spread for each time period chosen.  

  I like the way you can thus change each miniature "artwork" to suit the mood, rather like propping open a book of poems and concentrating on one piece for a while, rereading it over and over."
