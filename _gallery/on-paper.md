  Jeni is fascinated by pure colour and how colours interact with each other.
  She explores this in her art works on paper which are developed as part of the
  creative process. Sometimes these are translated into a textile, others stand
  as pieces in their own right.<br>Jeni uses cut and torn paper collages as a
  starting point for many of her designs which are then painted, but she is
  perhaps best known for her cut-outs. These are made by carving shapes into
  hand painted sheets of paper and working with both positive and negative
  images building up a low relief effect.

      **Design - Archbishop's Cushion, Lambeth Palace Chapel**<br>430 x 890
      mm<br>Design for tapestry cushion for Archbishop of Canterbury's stall.
      Lambeth Palace Chapel. &gt; Three artists were commissioned to design and
      weave cushions for the stalls in the restored Lambeth Palace Chapel. Using
      medieval tiles as the starting point for the designs each weaver had a
      similar footage to work with, although some cushions were larger than
      others. I designed a set of twelve, arranged in three sets of four and one
      single one for the Archbishop. 430 x 890mm.
