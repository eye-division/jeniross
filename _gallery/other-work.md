title: Other Work
description_markdown: >-
  Jeni is fascinated by pure colour and how colours interact with each other.
  She&nbsp; explores this in her paintings and design work on paper as part of
  the creative process. Sometimes these are&nbsp; developed further and
  translated into a textile work, others stand as pieces in their own right.
  &nbsp;


  Jeni uses cut and torn paper collages as a starting point for many of her
  designs which are then painted, but she is perhaps best known for her
  cut-outs.&nbsp; These are made by carving shapes into hand painted sheets of
  paper and working with both positive and negative images building up a low
  relief effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;


  As part of my initial research for the New College tapestries I experimented
  with a series of small books. My ideas for the&nbsp; project were related to
  Johannes Itten’s twelve tone colour system and I have translated these into a
  series of twenty four hour ‘clock’ books, starting and ending with midnight
  and centred on a sun motif in the middle.<br>The classic book form has a time
  based narrative; a concertina book on the other hand can be read all at once
  offering a more visual experience.
