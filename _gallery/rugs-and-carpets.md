title: Rugs and carpets
description_markdown: >-
  Jeni has designed a number of one-off carpets and limited edition rugs which
  have formed an important part of her commissioned work. &nbsp;


  Both public and private clients commission bespoke rugs for specific
  locations. Sometimes these are designed to be part of an existing design
  scheme in a room or alternatively a rug or carpet is seen as fitting into a
  larger scheme in a public building such as the "Magic Carpet" for Norwich
  Castle and the "Macro-Micro" carpet in the Central Science laboratory atrium.
