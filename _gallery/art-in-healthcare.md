title: "Art in Healthcare"
description_markdown: >-
  I believe strongly in the value of Art in Healthcare and have been successfully involved in a number of public art projects in hospitals. I am sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the healthcare environment; in each case my work has been very well received and has often led to follow up commissions. 

  I have designed tufted pile wall hangings and framed works on paper for the public areas of many NHS buildings.

      Wall Piece:1300 x 1600 mm
      Gouache on Paper, mixed media

      Design for Tufted Pile Wall Textile.  Shannon Clinic,  South Belfast Trust. 2004.

      I used the four ancient elements of “Earth, Air, Fire and Water” for this design.  My aim is for a piece that would encompass the idea of nature mentioned in the brief and also have an optimistic feel.

      Woven Tapestry

      Woven Tapestry for Mid-Kent Oncology Centre, Maidstone, Kent.

      The nature of the site required a particularly sensitive approach and my aim was to convey a sense of hope and healing.  The design also contains references to the local landscape.  The piece was sponsored by Powell Moya and Marley Floors and came out of a previous commission for the same architects.

      Approx height 1 metre
      Hand Gun-tufted Wool Pile

      Wall mounted tufted textile  pieces for 2 Childrens Treatment Centres, South Belfast Trust. Each approx. H: 1 metre.        2005

      Children respond to faces,  colour  and texture  from a very early age.  They are used to seeing faces  in many different guises - toys, games, books, cartoons. They are used to interpreting simple shapes and exploring with their own imagination and good use of colour helps  people feel more at ease.

      My approach was to use all these elements to design a group of images that will appeal to all ages and could be used in different ways according to the specific site.
